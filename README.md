# Binary Search in Java

## Objective
This project implements the Binary Search Algorithm to efficiently locate an element in a sorted list. It demonstrates divide-and-conquer techniques for optimizing search operations.

## Skills Learned
- Understanding of searching algorithms and their time complexity  
- Implementing binary search using both iterative and recursive approaches  
- Optimizing search operations for large datasets  

## Tools Used
- Java (for implementing the algorithm)  
- Eclipse IDE (for development and debugging)  
- JUnit Testing (for verifying correctness of implementations)  

## Implementation Details
The program consists of:
1. Iterative Binary Search: Uses a loop to divide the array and search for the target element.  
2. Recursive Binary Search: Implements a recursive function to divide and search.  
3. Performance Comparison: Compares iterative and recursive approaches based on execution time.  
4. Input Handling Module: Reads user input or predefined arrays for testing.  

## Steps
1. Initialize a sorted array of integers.  
2. Implement binary search using both iterative and recursive methods.  
3. Compare performance between the two approaches.  
4. Test the algorithm with different input sizes.  
5. Output the index of the target element (or indicate if not found).
